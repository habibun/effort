    /* length */
    //To find the length of a string, access its length property:
    console.log('hello'.length);    //5

    /* method */
    //There's our first brush with JavaScript objects! Did I mention that you can use strings like objects too? They have methods as well that allow you to manipulate the string and access information about the string:
    console.log('hello'.charAt(0));     //h
    console.log('hello, world'.replace('hello','goodbye'));     //goodbye, world
    console.log('hello'.toUpperCase());
