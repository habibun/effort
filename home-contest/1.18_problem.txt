Combining the header() function to change the content type of what your PHP pro‚Äê
gram outputs with the fputcsv() function for data formatting lets you send CSV files
to browsers that will be automatically handed off to a spreadsheet program (or whatever
application is configured on a particular client system to handle CSV files).
Example 1-38 formats the results of an SQL SELECT query as CSV data and provides the
correct headers so that it is properly handled by the browser.
