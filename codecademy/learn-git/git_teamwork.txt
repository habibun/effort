git clone remote_location clone_name
 In order to get your own replica of science-quizzes, you'll need to clone it with:

git remote -v
You can see a list of a Git project's remotes with the command:


git fetch
This command will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository. It brings those changes onto what's called a remote branch.


git merge origin/master
Now we'll use the git merge command to integrate origin/master into your local master branch.


git push origin your_branch_name
will push your branch up to the remote, origin.
