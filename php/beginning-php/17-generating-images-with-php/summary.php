imagegif(), and imagepng()

imagerectangle(), imageellipse(), imagearc(), and imagepolygon()



❑
Saw how to open existing images with imagecreatefromjpeg(), imagecreatefromgif(),
and imagecreatefrompng() so that you can manipulate them. By way of example, you
applied a watermark image to an existing photograph, and created a thumbnail image based on
an existing image. Along the way you looked at the concepts of transparency and opacity
