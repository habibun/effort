❑
How to write modular code: This involves splitting your code into small, easy-to-maintain
chunks that can often be reused by different applications. You briefly revisited functions and
classes, looked at PHP’s include(), require(), include_once(), and require_once()
functions that let you split your application across different script files, and took a quick look at
using namespaces to avoid clashing function, method, and constant names across code modules


❑
How to create and use coding standards: Coding standards help you write consistently
formatted, readable code that’s easier to maintain. You looked at some of the conventions used
in PHP and other languages


❑
Creating code documentation: You learned why comments and code documentation are an
integral part of well-written applications, and studied how to write good comments and use
phpDocumentor to generate documentation


❑
Application security: This important, often-overlooked aspect of Web programming is a critical
part of any robust application. You looked at how to check and filter user input to ensure its
integrity, as well as how to encode or escape your application’s output to ensure that it contains
only safe data


❑
Error handling: For your application to behave as reliably as possible, it needs to handle
problems gracefully. You saw how to use PHP’s error handling and logging functions to deal
with errors, and how to use the power of exception classes to create flexible, robust error
handling code


❑
Separating application and presentation code: You looked at how to move your presentation
markup into separate template files, thereby creating a clean division between your
application’s business logic and its visual interface. Doing this makes your application code
much easier to work with, both for designers and for programmers


❑
Unit testing: You learned about the benefits of code testing in general, and unit testing in
particular. Testing code early and often saves a lot of headaches further down the line. You
looked briefly at PHPUnit, a testing framework that lets you easily write your own
automated unit tests
