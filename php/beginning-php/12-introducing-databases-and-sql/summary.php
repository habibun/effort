❑
You studied embedded, client-server, simple, and relational databases, and saw that a relational
database such as MySQL stores its data as rows and columns in tables. You discovered that by
splitting your data over more than one table, you can make your database more efficient — a
process known as normalization

❑
In preparation for working with MySQL, you learned the basics of the SQL language, and
explored MySQL data types and indexes (keys). You also looked at the concept of NULL values

❑
Putting theory into practice, you learned how to start your MySQL server, set up a root
password, create databases and tables, add data to tables, and read, update, and delete data in
tables. You also learned how to delete whole tables and databases

❑
In the final section of the chapter, you took a quick look at connecting to MySQL from your PHP
scripts using the PDO extension. You learned how to set up a connection, how to handle errors,
and how to read data from a table
