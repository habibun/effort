git show HEAD
In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit.
To see the HEAD commit:



git checkout HEAD filename
will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.



git diff
to see the difference between scene-5.txt as it appears in the working directory vs. how it appears in your last commit.


git add filename_1 filename_2
Add the files to the staging area together



git reset HEAD filename
We can unstage that file from the staging area using


git reset 5d69206/SHA
Git enables you to rewind to the part before you made the wrong turn and create a new destiny for the project
go back to specific commit
