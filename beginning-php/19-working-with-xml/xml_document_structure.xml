Hereâ€™s an enhanced version of the stockList example document used earlier that illustrates each of
        these major parts. First the XML declaration:
        -->


        <!-- Next is the reference to a DTD that defines the allowed elements and attributes in the document: -->
        <!DOCTYPE stockList SYSTEM "http://www.example.com/dtds/stockList.dtd">


       <!-- Now the root element begins. Remember that there can be only one root element in an XML document: -->
<stockList>

        </stockList>

<!-- Creating an XHTML Document -->
        <!--
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
