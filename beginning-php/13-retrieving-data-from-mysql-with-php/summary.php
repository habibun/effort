❑
First you set up the tables for an imaginary book club database that you used throughout the
chapter. Along the way, you explored the BINARY attribute and case-sensitivity; the UNIQUE
constraint for enforcing unique values in a column; the ENUM data type for creating fields with a
small number of possible values; and the TIMESTAMP data type for automatically recording
when records are created or updated

❑
Next, you took a closer look at the SQL SELECT statement. You learned how to use LIMIT to
restrict the number of rows returned from a query, and how to sort the rows of a result set using
the ORDER BY clause. You saw how to make queries more flexible by using the LIKE and NOT
LIKE operators, and how to use functions such as count(), sum(), min(), max(), and avg() to
summarize columns in a table


❑
Duplicate rows can be a problem in result sets, and you saw how to solve this issue by using the
DISTINCT keyword. You also learned how to group results by a specified column or columns
through the use of GROUP BY clauses


❑
One of the main advantages of a relational database is that you can pull data from more than
one table at a time — a process known as joining tables. You learned how to do this, and also
how to use aliases to make both queries and result sets more readable


❑
To round off the discussion on SELECT queries, you explored a few of the myriad MySQL
operators and functions that you can use to add even more power to your queries
